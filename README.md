# HeritageCombs

Heritage Combs is a group project created during the Crowd-Sourced and Citizen Data for Cultural Heritage module in the UCL Data Science for Cultural Heritage MSc programme. You can find the project on [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/ucl-dot-dasch/heritage-combs), but we aren't collecting more data at the moment.

This repo includes materials for my presentation at a monthly ConCode meeting in April 2021 called "Zooniverse for Heritage Projects: Zooming through Zooniverse Data." ConCode is a group open to anyone with an interest in cultural heritage and coding. The goal of this presentation is to show people how to create a project in Zooniverse, clean the data in R to prepare for analysis, and present some results from the project.

See this tutorial on how to clean up data from Zooniverse in R: https://rpubs.com/emilylong/zooniverse

Download the corresponding R code file (**CleaningZooniverseData.R**) to follow along. 

The test data is in the **heritage-combs-classifications.csv** file. Note that this data is all generated by myself. My username in Zooniverse is 'ucl.dasch', I added 'bad.user' and 'bad.user2' as examples, and the not-logged-in users are just me on different devices. Do not try to draw any statistical conclusions from this data. 

The slides from my presentation are in **ZooniverseSlides.pdf**.

The markdown files (**ZooniverseDataCleaning.hmtl & .Rmd**) are here if you are so inclined.

After testing this data, I actually found out something interesting about how Zooniverse assigns usernames to participants who aren't logged in. See my question on [Zooniverse Talk](https://www.zooniverse.org/talk/18/1946121) and the file **SessionData.png** for more details.
