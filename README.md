# HeritageCombs

Heritage Combs is a group project created during the Crowd-Sourced and Citizen Data... module through the UCL Data Science for Cultural Heritage MSc programme.

This repo includes materials for my presentation at a monthly ConCode meeting in April 2021 called "Zooniverse for Heritage Projects: Zooming through Zooniverse Data." ConCode is a group open to anyone with an interest in cultural heritage, conservation, and coding. 

The goal of this presentation is to show ...

See the R markdown file for a tutorial on how to clean up data from Zooniverse in R.

The corresponding R code file is essentially the same as the tutorial, but with fewer comments. If you're new to R, I recommend the tutorial. :)

Note: the data included in this folder is all responses to the Zooniverse questionnaire from myself, so that people can get a feel for the Zooniverse output. The data in this folder is not intended to be analysed.
